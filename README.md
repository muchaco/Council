## What is Council?

Council functions as a self-regulating meeting room: you define the problem, and a cast of custom "Personas"—equipped with distinct personalities, specific LLM models, and private instructions—discuss it while an AI "Orchestrator" directs the flow, managing turn-taking and maintaining a live "Blackboard" of consensus to prevent circular arguments.

It is a tool for rapid ideation and rigorous critique, allowing you to step back and watch a simulated expert panel dismantle and reconstruct your ideas until a definitive solution is reached.
